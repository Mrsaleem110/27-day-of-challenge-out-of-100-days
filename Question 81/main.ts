// *Question 81:* Iterating Over Object Properties: Write a function that takes an object as an argument and logs all of its properties and values.

// *Explain & TIP:* You can loop through each property of an object using a for...in loop. This is useful for when you need to examine or display all the information an object holds.

function logObjectProperties(obj: object) {
    for (let property in obj) {
        // Loops through each property in the object
        console.log(`${property}: ${obj[property]}`);
        // Shows the property name and its value
    }
}

// Using the function with a car object
logObjectProperties({ make: "Toyota", model: "Corolla", year: 2021, color: "blue" });
